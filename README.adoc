= Health Check - Eclipse Vert.x Booster

IMPORTANT: While you can run and interact with this booster on our local host, you cannot take advantage of using the health check functionality with this booster without using OpenShift. For more details on using this booster with a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/vertx-runtime.html[Eclipse Vert.x Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This booster requires Java 8 JDK or greater and Maven 3.3.x or greater.

IMPORTANT: As part of the process of creating this booster, launch.openshift.io set up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your Single-node OpenShift Cluster or OpenShift Online Web Console. 

== Running the Booster Locally
To run this booster on your local host:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:cescoffier/health-check-0

$ cd health-check-0

$ mvn compile vertx:run
----

== Interacting with the Booster Locally
To interact with your booster while its running, use the form at `http://localhost:8080` or the `curl` command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello, World!"}

$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/greeting?name=Sarah
{"content":"Hello, Sarah!"}
----

== Running the Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your booster there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Log in and create your project.
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME

$ mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----


== Interacting with the Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster

To interact with your booster while it's running on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster, you first need to obtain it's URL:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get route booster-health-check-ver -o jsonpath={$.spec.host}

booster-health-check-ver-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME
----


You can use the form at your application's url or you can use the `curl` command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ curl http://booster-health-check-ver-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/greeting
{"content":"Hello World!"}

$ curl http://booster-health-check-ver-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/greeting?name=Sarah
{"content":"Hello Sarah!"}

$ curl http://booster-health-check-ver-MY_PROJECT_NAME.LOCAL_OPENSHIFT_HOSTNAME/api/stop

$ oc get pods -w
NAME                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
booster-health-check-ver-1-26iy7   1/1       Running   5          18m
----

When `READY` changes to `0/1`, if you re-execute a `curl` command to `api/greeting` or attempt to access the application's URL, it will be unavailable. When `READY` changes back to `1/1`, `curl` commands and the application URL will be available again.
